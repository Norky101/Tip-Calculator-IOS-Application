## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [-] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [-] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [-] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [-] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Some challenges I had with this project included trying to get the Second view-controller Field Labels to connect to the main view-controller. 
Specifically, I wanted the user to have the ability to change the default values on the tip percentages segmented controller. 

To do this, I had to connect the field Labels, to my Second ViewController, then create a function that will connect and update the tip values. 

In addition, getting used to a different style of production was difficult. Typically, I am used to solely coding without visuals to aid me. So having to go back and forth was something I had to get used to.
